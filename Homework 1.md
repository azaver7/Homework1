# The rise of Zelle

## Overview and Origin

Name of the company: Zelle

The company was founded in 2017.

The company is owned and operated by Early Warning Services, LLC, which is co-owned by 7 of the big banks.

The rising competition between Paypal's Venmo and Block's CashApp brought the idea of Zelle into the mix. The increase in peer to peer money transfers was also a bullish indication for the creation of this company.

The company is funded by Warning Services, LLC which is backed by the 7 largest banks of the nation. After extensive research, there is no indication on the total amount that was funded for this project. However, it is believed that the 7 banks played a big role in funding.

## Business Activities:

Zelle has been put under heavy notice by government officials since they have been considered an easy "facilitator" for fraud and theft. This has been one of the biggest financial problems Zelle has been trying to tackle for the past 2 years.

The company's intended customer/target audience is every person that has a bank account and performs day-to-day peer transactions within that account. Zelle has managed to add itself to 15 well known banks so far. There isn't a specific size of the customers however age is one of the main metrics they have used as a way to accumulate their target audience. Zelle has targeted the ages ranging from 18 to 54. Additionally, ages over 55 have recently increased their use of Zelle. One of the biggest advantages that separates Zelle from the rest is that it only requires the customer to enter the recipient's phone number or email to send money. The transaction is also instant and takes less than 1 minute. This can also be done between an U.S bank account.

Zelle uses Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments system. This allows them to speed payments between different U.S bank accounts. A regular ACH payment processed from an individual takes approximately 3 days whereas with Zelle, it only takes a few minutes. According to stackshare, Zelle uses New Relic and Varnish as their DevOps.

## Landscape

This company falls under the Payments/Billing domain of FinTech.

Some of the major trends in the past few years have been implementing more artificial intelligence and machine learning. Open banking has been something that has become very popular in today's world. A good example of this would be Instagram and Facebook offering services such as marketing and a marketplace to purchase/sell products. Lastly, Neobanking is one of the few trends that has grown severely over the past 5 years. Chime is an excellent example of Neobanking.

Some of the other major companies in this domain are Venmo, Paypal, Apple Pay, Cashapp, and Meta Pay.

## Results 

In a world where everyone and everything is moving rapidly and efficiently, Zelle has completely changed the P2P game. This company has more than doubled since 2022 and that has been due to its efficiency, rapid transactions, instant funding, and recipient satisfaction. Every alternative/competitor takes at least 2 to 3 days to get the funds transferred to a recipient's bank account.

P2P mobile payments transaction value and P2P mobile payment users are the two most important core metrics that determines their success. Zelle is currently outperforming the second biggest P2P company which would be Venmo. They have 2.23 times more immigrants using Zelle and retaining 2.28 times more immigrants than Venmo.

As mentioned above, Zelle is outperforming every single one of these P2P companies at the moment. The biggest factor is their increase in usage and retention of customers. Customers transfer 3.4 times more with Zelle and the number of people using Zelle is continuously increasing. 

## Recommendation

If I were to advise Zelle, I would recommend they increase the limit on the total amount of money an individual can send from their account. Granted they have to deal with fraud charges and adding this would only increase it more. However, adding an additional layer of security and requiring the customer to fill in more information about the recipient can certainly help. I would also recommend adding a 30 to 60 second hold feature that customers can choose to add or not. This would basically process the transaction but give you 30 to 60 seconds after to either cancel or change the amount. 

I believe this would benefit the company in multiple ways as this could be one of the solutions to help prevent fraud charges and also prevent customers from sending money to random people on accident. There have been instances where a person may sometimes type the wrong number and send money to some other person. Lastly, this would also increase the total amount of money that will be passed through Zelle and only boost their numbers.

I believe Zelle is already using ACH and some encryption technology. I believe they would need to use these even more and add some more coding to make the above recommendations happen. There isn't any additional technology that they would need for this specifically.

These technologies are appropriate because Zelle is already using them and they are some of the most trusted technologies that are widely used by big companies.
